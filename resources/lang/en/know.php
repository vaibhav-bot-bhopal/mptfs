    'ptiger_div1' => "The presence of tiger symbolizes a healthy ecosystem as it is an umbrella species. Tiger is symbol of wilderness and well-being of the ecosystem. By conserving and saving tigers the entire wilderness of ecosystem is conserved. In nature, barring human beings and their domesticate, rest of the ecosystem is wild. Hence conserving wilderness is important and crucial to maintain the life support system. So, saving tiger amounts to saving the ecosystem which is crucial for man's own survival.",

    'ptiger_heading_h3' => 'The Project Tiger',

    'ptiger_div2' => 'After Independence, India as a country was focused on socio-economic development while wildlife hunting was quite prominent initially. However after the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 came into existence the idea of Environment, Wildlife and Tiger Conservation started to make
    its mark in the country. In year 2000, number to Tigers in the country were estimated to be 4000
    and 700 in state of Madhya Pradesh. However in the tiger census of 2006, only 1411 tigers were
    estimated in the whole country. This was way less than the estimated 4000 in the year 2000,
    while their number in the state was estimated only to be 300. Although Madhya Pradesh
    remained the state with the highest number of tigers in 2006, but the declining numbers were
    a matter of concern. To add to the woes, a news came in year 2008 that the Panna Tiger Reserve,
    considered to be the pride of the state, became tigerless.',

    'ptiger_div3' => "In the All India Tiger Census of 2010 the numbers of Tigers in the state were estimated at 257. Madhya Pradesh since long had been identified with its dense forest and tigers living in those forests, however after registering the presence of 257 tigers in All India Tiger Census 2010, Karnataka was given the status of Tiger State of India.",

    'ptiger_div4' => "In the Tiger Census of year 2014, presence of 308 tigers was estimated in Madhya Pradesh, and by then the state had slipped further to third place after Karnataka and Uttarakhand in terms of number of Tigers. Even though 286 tigers were recorded in the camera traps, much more than
    260 in Karnataka and 267 in Uttarakhand; the final figures of the census, the numbers of tigers
    estimated in Karnataka stood at 406, against estimate of 308 Tigers in Madhya Pradesh.",

    'ptiger_learning' => "Learning lessons from the results of All India Tiger Census 2014, a focused approach toward conservation and management was taken up by the Forest Department and the census of 2018 was taken as a mission. In Madhya Pradesh the frontline staff regularly reported of Tigers
    roaming outside the protected areas and their management was a tough challenge; most important task being protecting tigers from poachers and to manage their habitat and food etc.
    The officers/staff of the department left no stone unturned for conservation and management
    of tigers in spite of adverse conditions, as a result of which the state regained its lost status of
    being the Tiger State of India in the year 2019 with the announcement of results of All India
    Tiger Estimation 2018.",

    'ptiger_extra_p1' => 'A Three pronged strategy was devised for the census of tigers of 2018. First, more attention was given to those areas where there were higher cases of cattle killing by tigers. While 1000 cattle were hunted by tigers in the year 2009-10, the number had increased to 3000 in 2017-18. Cattles are the preferred prey of tigers in the buffer zones of Tiger Reserves and areas outside of Protected Area. It was quite evident that the number of tigers present in the buffer
    zones/unprotected areas was also quite high along with the core zones of the Tiger Reserves
    and special attention was paid to such areas.',

    'ptiger_extra_p2' => 'Second, very well structed training was given to the employees of the department to make them well versed with all the steps, procedures as well as to use the innovative GIS Mapping/MStripes Software to utilized for calculations and recording of data. Instead of the
    usual practice of training senior officers , about 250 ground staff (forest guard, deputy forest
    guard, etc) were trained to become the master trainers. As master trainer they then trained
    9000 forest guards and 4500 senior officers as well as the volunteers for the census. This was
    done keeping in view a futuristic thought that the ground staff would not only help in getting
    accurate data during estimation of 2018 but would also be more attentive about their area and
    inform the department about the presence of wildlife in their area in future. With better
    information, better management of wildlife can be achieved. Training program was organized
    after dividing all 51 districts of Madhya Pradesh into 7 zones (Tiger Reserves -
    Kanha/Satpura/Bandhavgarh/Pench/Panna, Madhav National Park and Ujjain). Forest Research
    Institute, Jabalpur and WWF played an important role during these training program.',

    'ptiger_extra_p3' => 'Third, Social media and smart phone apps were also used to motivate employees as well as for quick communication. Posters and various slogans were used to encourage the
    employees/officers which were circulated using social media and other apps. The limited
    availability of various scientific equipment and the lack of resources were also overcome by the
    department. Equipment and resources were used in one area in a time bound manner and then
    transported to other places within least possible time to cover as much area as possible.',

    'ptiger_extra_p4' => 'During the tiger census 2018, more than 12000 forest workers and hundreds of volunteers searched every nook and corner of the forests to find evidence of the presence of the tiger. Finally their hard work paid off and the state regained the status of the tiger state. The title of Tiger State is because of all the employees who sacrificed their personal time, living in
    inaccessible forests, staying away from their family members for the protection of the wildlife and Tigers. In Madhya Pradesh the Estimate of Tiger as per AITE 2018 now stands at 526 as against 524 for Karnataka. Madhya Pradesh is currently the Tiger State of India.',

    'ptiger_div5' => 'The Government of India had launched "Project Tiger" on 1st April 1973 to promote conservation of the tiger. Project Tiger has been the largest species conservation initiative of its kind in the world. While the field implementation of the project, protection and management in the designated reserves is done by the project States, who also provide the matching grant to recurring items of expenditure, deploy field staff/officers, and give their salaries, the Project Tiger Directorate of the Ministry of Environment and Forests was mandated with the task of providing technical guidance and funding support.',
    'ptiger_div6' => "The implementation of Project Tiger over the years has highlighted the need for a statutory authority with legal backing to ensure tiger conservation. On the basis of the recommendations of National Board for Wild Life chaired by the Hon'ble Prime Minister, a Task Force was set up to look into the problems of tiger conservation in the country. The recommendations of the said Task Force, interlaid include strengthening of Project Tiger by giving it statutory and administrative powers, apart from creating the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau. It has also recommended that an annual report should be submitted to the Central Government for laying in Parliament, so that commitment to Project Tiger is reviewed from time to time, in addition to addressing the concerns of local people.

    'ptiger_ntca_div' => 'Considering the urgency of the situation, Project Tiger has been converted into a statutory authority (National Tiger Conservation Authority) by providing enabling provisions in the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 through an amendment, viz. Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Act, 2006. This forms one of the urgent recommendations of the Tiger Task Force appointed by the Prime Minister. The NTCA addresses the ecological as well as administrative concerns for conserving tigers, by providing a statutory basis for protection of tiger reserves, apart from providing strengthened institutional mechanisms for the protection of ecologically sensitive areas and endangered species. The Authority also ensures enforcing of guidelines for tiger conservation and monitoring compliance of the same, apart from placement of motivated and trained officers having good track record as Field Directors of tiger reserves. It also facilitates capacity building of officers and staff posted in tiger reserves, apart from a time bound staff development plan. The Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Act, 2006 has come into force with effect from the 4th of September, 2006, and the NTCA has also been constituted on the same date.',
